- Apply input validation techniques using loops to ensure data integrity.
- Master the use of nested loops to handle complex iterative scenarios.


## Introduction to Loops (Repetition Structures)

### Concept

A loop enables a statement or set of statements to execute repeatedly. This approach is more efficient and maintainable than writing the same code multiple times.

### Example: Calculating Sales Commissions Without a Loop

Imagine you need to calculate and display commissions for three salespeople. Instead of using a loop, you would write separate blocks of code for each salesperson:

```python
# Salesperson 1
sales1 = float(input('Enter the amount of sales for salesperson 1: '))
comm_rate1 = float(input('Enter the commission rate: '))
commission1 = sales1 * comm_rate1
print('The commission for salesperson 1 is Le', format(commission1, ',.2f'), sep='')

# Salesperson 2
sales2 = float(input('Enter the amount of sales for salesperson 2: '))
comm_rate2 = float(input('Enter the commission rate: '))
commission2 = sales2 * comm_rate2
print('The commission for salesperson 2 is Le', format(commission2, ',.2f'), sep='')

# Salesperson 3
sales3 = float(input('Enter the amount of sales for salesperson 3: '))
comm_rate3 = float(input('Enter the commission rate: '))
commission3 = sales3 * comm_rate3
print('The commission for salesperson 3 is Le', format(commission3, ',.2f'), sep='')

```
## Condition-Controlled and Count-Controlled Loops

We are going to explore two main types of loops: **condition-controlled** and **count-controlled** loops. 

- **Condition-Controlled Loop:**
  - It execute contineously as long as a specified condition remains true.
  - It is implemented using the `while` statement.
  -  It is useful when the number of iterations is not known ahead of time and depends on dynamic conditions.

- **Count-Controlled Loop:**
    - This type of loop runs a specific number of times
    - The number of iterations is predetermined.
    - This is achieved using the `for` statement.
    - It is ideal when the exact number of iterations is known before starting the loop.

### Checkpoint Questions

1. **What is a repetition structure in programming?**
2. **How does a condition-controlled loop operate and what keyword is used to implement it in Python?**
3. **What defines a count-controlled loop and which Python statement is used for this purpose?**
4. **Can you provide an example of when you would use a condition-controlled loop versus a count-controlled loop?**
5. **What are the main advantages of using loops instead of writing repetitive code blocks manually?**

We will guide you through writing and using both types of loops to handle various programming tasks efficiently.

## The `while` Loop: A Condition-Controlled Loop

### Concept

A `while` loop in Python allows you to repeat a set of instructions as long as a specified condition remains true. It's useful when you don't know in advance how many times you need to execute the statements.

**How It Works:**
1. **Condition:** The loop starts by checking if a condition is true or false.
2. **Statements:** If the condition is true, it executes a block of statements.
3. **Repeat:** After executing the statements, the loop checks the condition again. If it's still true, it repeats the process.
4. **Exit:** If the condition becomes false, the loop ends and the program continues with the next part of the code.

Hereâ€™s the basic structure of a `while` loop in Python:

```python
while condition:
    # statements to execute
```

### Example Password Verification

Problem: Write a program that repeatedly prompts the user to enter the correct password. The loop should end when the correct password is entered.
```python
correct_password = 'secure123'
entered_password = ''

while entered_password != correct_password:
    entered_password = input('Enter the password: ')
    
print('Password accepted!')
```
### Example :Sum of Numbers

Problem: Write a program that prompts the user to enter numbers and adds them to a total until the user enters 0.
```python
total = 0
number = float(input('Enter a number (0 to stop): '))

while number != 0:
    total += number
    number = float(input('Enter another number (0 to stop): '))

print(f'The total sum is {total:.2f}.')
```

### Example: Guessing Game

Problem: Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10 and repeatedly prompts the user to guess the number until they guess correctly.

```python
import random

number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)
guess = 0

while guess != number_to_guess:
    guess = int(input('Guess the number (1-10): '))
    
print('Congratulations! You guessed the number.')
```
### Example Age Checker

Problem: Write a program that asks for the user's age and keeps asking until the user provides a valid age (a positive number).
```python
age = -1

while age <= 0:
    age = int(input('Enter your age: '))
    
print(f'Your age is {age}.')
```
### Example: Countdown Timer

Problem: Write a program that counts down from 10 to 1 and then prints "Blast off!"
```python
count = 10
while count > 0:
    print(count)
    count -= 1
print('Blast off!')
```

### Exercise 1: Number Sum
Write a program that continuously prompts the user to enter positive numbers and keeps a running total. The program should stop when the user enters `0` and then display the total sum of the entered numbers.

```python
total = 0
number = float(input('Enter a positive number (0 to stop): '))

while number != 0:
    total += number
    number = float(input('Enter another number (0 to stop): '))

print(f'The total sum is {total:.2f}.')
```
### Example  Factorial Calculator
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user. The program should repeatedly prompt the user to enter a positive integer until they enter a number greater than or equal to 0, then compute and display the factorial of that number.

```python

number = int(input('Enter a positive integer to calculate its factorial: '))
factorial = 1

while number < 0:
    number = int(input('Invalid input. Enter a positive integer: '))

while number > 0:
    factorial *= number
    number -= 1

print(f'The factorial is {factorial}.')

```

### Example Even Number Counter
Write a program that asks the user to enter numbers and counts how many of the entered numbers are even. The program should stop when the user enters -1.

```python
count = 0
number = int(input('Enter a number (-1 to stop): '))

while number != -1:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        count += 1
    number = int(input('Enter another number (-1 to stop): '))

print(f'The number of even numbers entered is {count}.')
```
### Example: Age Group Identifier
Write a program that continuously prompts the user to enter their age and categorizes them into different age groups: "Child" (0-12), "Teenager" (13-19), and "Adult" (20 and above). The program should stop when the user enters -1.
```python
age = int(input('Enter your age (-1 to stop): '))

while age != -1:
    if age <= 12:
        print('You are a Child.')
    elif age <= 19:
        print('You are a Teenager.')
    else:
        print('You are an Adult.')
    age = int(input('Enter your age (-1 to stop): '))

```
### Example
Consider a program that calculates sales commissions repeatedly until the user decides to stop:
```python
# This program calculates sales commissions.

# Create a variable to control the loop.
keep_going = 'y'

# Calculate a series of commissions.
while keep_going == 'y':
    # Get a salesperson's sales and commission rate.
    sales = float(input('Enter the amount of sales: '))
    comm_rate = float(input('Enter the commission rate: '))
    
    # Calculate the commission.
    commission = sales * comm_rate
    
    # Display the commission.
    print(f'The commission is ${commission:,.2f}.')
    
    # See if the user wants to do another one.
    keep_going = input('Do you want to calculate another commission (Enter y for yes): ')
```
