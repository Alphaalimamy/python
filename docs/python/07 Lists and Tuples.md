### Sequences
- A sequence is an object that holds multiple items of data, stored one after the other.
- You can perform operations on a sequence to examine and manipulate the items stored in it.

### Introduction to Lists
- A list is an object that contains multiple data items.
- Lists are mutable, which means that their contents can be changed during a programâ€™s execution.
- Lists are dynamic data structures, meaning that items may be added to them or removed from them.
- You can use **indexing, slicing,** and various methods to work with lists in a program
- A list is an object that contains multiple data items.
- Each item that is stored in a list is called an element.
- Here is a statement that creates a list of integers:
```python

even_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
print(even_numbers)
```
- The items that are enclosed in brackets and separated by commas are the list elements
